					<h3>Where Briskstar is based in? What is the workforce?</h3>
					<p>Since 1997, we have been a leading offshore software development IT company headquartered in Ahmedabad, India. Ahmedabad belongs to the state of Gujarat, and is one of the fastest growing cities. We have presence in Los Angeles, USA too. We have a very talented team of more than 450+ great people, the majority of which are in our headquarters in Ahmedabad.</p>
					
					<h3>What is your core expertise and industry experience?</h3>
					<p>We have an extremely talented team of web and mobile app developers who can build great Mobile Apps, Websites and Games. When we started in 1997, we began with web development services. Since then, we’ve come a long way, especially since the launch of smartphones. Over the era of more than two decades, we have been a class apart when it comes to web development, mobile app development, and game app development services.</p>
					
					<h3>What about secrecy of my Idea?</h3>
					<p>Everything begins with an Idea and we know – each idea is precious. We take great responsibility in ensuring your idea remains confidential. To accompany our commitment, we sign Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) right before any discussion. Even during the web or mobile app development project, we ensure strict security and confidentiality measures to nullify the unauthorized sharing of information. We also have legal agreements with all of our employees including software development teams for maintaining security and trust.</p>
					
					<h3>Do you reuse code?</h3>
					<p>It is a tricky question to be honest. We do not re-use your proprietary algorithms, license keys, trade secretes, trademarks, patented processes anywhere else. However, considering the authoring process of producing the code, we do use a lot of open source libraries and our own libraries to save development time and avoid re-inventing the wheel all over again. This ensures you do not have to pay for something that can be produced quicker and with more quality.</p>
					
					<h3>What is your project development methodology?</h3>
					<p>Every web or mobile app development project is unique and requires a fresh approach, but most projects pass through some of the most common project development steps – i.e. Requirement gathering, analysis, solution consulting, wireframe/prototyping, UI design, development, and testing. However, depending on the scope and type of the software development project, the sequence and selection of steps may vary.</p>

					<h3>Do you work according to client’s time zone?</h3>
					<p>All of our development team works out of our headquarter – Ahmedabad, India. However, depending on the nature of the work, specific situation and in case of special meetings, we can certainly stay awake to ensure we connect during your working hours. However, we’d prefer having this be scheduled prior to the event so that we can plan our rest of the schedules accordingly.</p>
					
					<h3>How do we communicate with the project or software development team?</h3>
					<p>We use Basecamp for project communications. We sign you up in there and loop you in with the rest of the Briskstar team who’s going to work on your project. Apart from basecamp – we of course use Email and Skype. You’ll generally discuss with a Project Manager and Tech Lead – but we’re not having constraints in case you want to speak to any member of the team who’s working on your project.</p>
